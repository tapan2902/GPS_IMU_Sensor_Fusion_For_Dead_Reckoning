# Analysis Scripts 

- **bag_MAT.py**: This script converts ROS 2 `.bag` files into `.mat` files. It is useful for exporting IMU data & GPS data to a format that can be analyzed in MATLAB or other tools that support `.mat` files. 

  **Usage**:
   ```bash
   python3 analysis_scripts/bag_Mat.py
   ```
   Ensure you update the script with the correct input `.bag` file path and output `.mat` file location.
